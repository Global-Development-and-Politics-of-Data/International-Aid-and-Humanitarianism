# International-Aid-and-Humanitarianism

## **Abstract**

Data on international aid and humanitarian assistance is varied, complex, and produced by a multitude of actors. This makes it hard to track where aid is going and what it is doing. Beyond that, countless collection methods and various reporting standards make it difficult to find what information is publicly available about said aid. The primary purpose of the accompanying chapter is to unpack the complicated aid data landscape and introduce students to the aid transparency movement. This module builds upon the context provided by the chapter asking students to consider: (1) the challenges of collecting good data on aid, (2) understanding how those datasets are constructed, and (3) how data can shape the narrative on aid and humanitarianism.
