# International-Aid-and-Humanitarianism

# **Abstract**

Data on international aid and humanitarian assistance is varied and complex and a multitude of actors make it hard to track where aid is going. Beyond that, countless collection methods and various reporting standards make it difficult to find what information is publicly available about that aid. The primary purpose of the accompanying chapter is to unpack the complicated aid data landscape and introduce students to the aid transparency movement. This module builds upon the context provided by the chapter asking students to consider: (1) the challenges of collecting good data on aid, (2) understanding how those datasets are constructed, and (3) how data manipulation impacts data on aid and humanitarianism. 

# **Data Sources**

The data come from: 
  X, 
  Y, 
  Z. 

# **Software**

This module relies on Excel. Excel offers an easy to use, common platform for data management and analysis.
