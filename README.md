# International-Aid-and-Humanitarianism

# **Abstract**

Data in international aid and humanitarianism is varied and complex. A multitude of actors and collection methods make it hard to track where aid is going--necessitating the creation of the aid transparency movement. This module takes students through the process of gathering humanitarian data to understand the challenges discussed in the Politics of Data section of Chapter 16 and revolves around the importance of understanding data collection and measurement. The theme of the chapter continues: we cannot know how effective aid is if we donâ€™t know how it is being measured and how exactly the data is collected. To illustrate this point, students will interact with data surrounding humanitarian aid in Lebanon. Regarding data collection, the students will explore data construction and organization that can impact how it can be analyzed, diving into the validity of the data to understand how accurately the datasets measure what they claim to. The purpose of this exercise is to allow students to apply the concepts from the chapter to consider how different measurements can result in different outcomes, and how to find the truth behind manipulated data and for what purpose data could be manipulated. Students will gain experience working in Excel, understanding the process for tidying data, and will become comfortable thinking critically about data collection. By the end of this module, students will have a deeper understanding of the power of the data collection process to shape results. Finally, students will use data visualizations to compare and contrast these relationships in Excel.
